# Workbench

This folder stores temporary and draft artifacts created during diagram/layout iteration.

- `mermaid_scratch/`
  - throwaway Mermaid experiments (`tmp_*.mmd`, `tmp_*.svg`)
  - not part of submission baseline

Keep final deliverables in `docs/` root and archive retired material in `docs/legacy_2026-02-19/`.
